# Comments

While comments are not standard markdown, HTML comments are still valid markdown.

```cs 

    var comment = new MdPlainText("This awesome file was auto-generated by an awesome file auto-generator");

    // Output:
    // <!-- This awesome file was auto-generated by an awesome file auto-generator -->

```

Supports multi-line comments as necessary.

```cs 

    var comment = 
        new MdComment()
        .AddLine("This is a comment")
        .AddLine(new MdPlainText("On two lines"));

    // Output:
    // <!--  
    // This is a comment
    // On two lines
    // -->

```

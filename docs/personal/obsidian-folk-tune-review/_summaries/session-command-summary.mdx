As an alternative to reviewing tunes selected by the CLI, you also get the opportunity to play tunes when others play them at sessions.

If you take a list of the tunes played in a session in a text file (one tune per line), you can upload the file and the `last-reviewed` date will be updated for each tune.

No review score is recorded against the tune but the `last-reviewed` date is later used to calculate when a review is due/overdue.

:::tip Quick start

As a minimum, navigate to the root directory of your vault and run the following command:

```powershell
tune-review --from-file "./path/to/file-listing-tunes-played-in-session.txt"
```

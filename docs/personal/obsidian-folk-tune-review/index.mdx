# Introduction

> Command-line application (CLI) that helps maintain a repertoire of already-learned folk tunes stored locally in an Obsidian vault.
> 
> The CLI selects a manageable number of tunes to review on a regular basis, records review state in the Obsidian vault, and supports filtering by tune metadata such as regional origin.

## Installation

:::tip Quick start

To install the CLI on your machine, run the following command in a terminal:

```powershell
dotnet tool install --global CloudAwesome.FolkTune.Reviewer
```

N.B. To use the CLI after installation, you must have an existing Obsidian vault in the specified format, including a directory of tunes in markdown format and with the mandatory metadata in yaml front matter.
